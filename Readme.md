# Custom web home
## Introduction
The Teach on Mars application is great out of the box, and its home screen may already be configured to suit your needs and graphical charter. But we thought some of you might like something more.

So here comes the Custom web home that allows you to create pretty much any kind of home screen as long as it is web based. This web home will be able to interact with the standard part of the application.

This project will provide the tools you need to develop a custom web home and test it against dummy data without leaving your development environment.

You will find more detailed information in the [Custom web home documentation](https://github.com/TeachonMars/CustomWebHome/doc/ToM%20Custom%20Web%20Home%20v18.3).
